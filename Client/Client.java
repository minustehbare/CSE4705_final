/***
 * <p>Used to connect to an Amazons server.  This class is responsible for managing
 * a connection to an Amazons server.  Each instance of this object can connect
 * to a different server, with a different username.</p>
 *
 * <p>Over the lifetime of a Client object, four methods should be called.  First,
 * Connect() should be called to initiate a connection with an Amazons server.
 * Next, LoginAndMatch() is called to authenticate the client and choose an
 * opponent.  After this, Play() is called and handed an object that implements
 * the ClientInterface interface.  It is through this object that the client plays
 * the game.</p>
 *
 * <p>Typically, all four of these methods would be called from the same block of
 * code.</p>
 *
 * <p>The outcome of the game is returned as a boolean from the Play() method.
 * If the game ended in an error, a ClientException will be thrown.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class is designed to have the various querying methods (like getState())
 * be called during execution of the Play() method, which may take up to 10 minutes.
 * The user may wish to launch the game in a separate thread.  To facilitate this,
 * this class is thread-safe.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that Client objects are NOT reusable.  If an error occurs or the game
 * ends, a new Client object must be created to play another game.</p>
